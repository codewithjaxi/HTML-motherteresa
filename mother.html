        <p>
            he reason I chose Mother Teresa for a women that has made a major contribution is because of all the contributions that she helped make for all those people in need and also because she a WOMEN created all of the organizations. Mother Teresa helped make these homes for people who did not have a place at all or any support system from anyone. Not only that she was also so accepting to other religions. I think it takes a lot to leave home all alone to become a nun and help others. Mother Teresa defiantly put others needs before hers to try to better everyone in general all she wanted from humans was peace. The fact that she was brave enough to do all this stuff without caring about how others though of her is very inspiring. She showed men that women are able to build things right from the bottom just the same as men can. Also the fact that she used her popularity in a good way to continue helping others, there was a certain situation where she was going to receive $192,000 and did not accept them instead she made it clear she wanted all of that money to go to her charity work so it could help others. Mother Teresa might not have been in the Feminist group trying to fight for women rights and things like that but she was defiantly a women who just was not trying to just help women she was helping everyone and saw a women and man equally the same.

            Shatni Nagar was the name of Mother Teresa's hospice for Leprosy Disease. Not only was there a hospice there were also many clinics through out Calcutta that gave them band-aids when they needed them, food, and medication whenever that was needed as well. Another heart warming thing she did was create an orphanage called Nirmal Shishu Bhavan for those young children who were lost or homeless. Another major thing i think is very important was how she created homes for those with HIV/AIDS. The home for the HIV/Aids was called Gift of Love. I think it was very thoughtful of her to do that because she was willing to be around HIV/Aids victims to help them. Aids was something that freaked people out back in the 1950s because there was not much information about it and that fact that she and other nuns risked their life's to help HIV/Aid victims shows how great Mother Teresa and her nuns were.
